Circles of Health is conceived as an advanced social network and it is focused on people with functional diversity problems. Its purpose is the social inclusion of all people. The participation is not only open to disabled people but also to health professionals and therapists, carers, institutions and stakeholders. Users will be able to share experiences, get specific information and knowledge, share it and give their opinions and eventually have repercussion on social policies. This network allows the user not only to share experiences and knowledge, but also to have access to special tools. These tools make the user be able to do comparative analysis about the quality of life, health indicators and rehabilitation therapies. In other words, it is a complete tool that will allow knowledge sharing.
